# F.A.Q.

Why don't you provide graphics in custom commissions?
:   Graphics manipulation is not a Magrathea specialty. Offering _high quality_ resources is an important part of Magrathea for us and, since graphics really aren't in our wheelhouse, this isn't an area where we can confidently meet the standard we've set.
    
    That said, we actually see the lack of graphics as a benefit overall. It encourages you to put your stamp on the theme, and for others to do the same when the theme becomes available open source. This is one (very important) way that future uses of the theme can differentiate themselves from each other, so even sites using the same theme feel more visually distinct.

Why GitHub?
:   [GitHub](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is built on top of [Git](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), an extremely popular distributed version control system (aka means of collaborating on code, each from your own computer, in a clean, structured way that tracks all changes). GitHub itself provides a way to use Git while adding a lot of great features on top. You can search for code repositories, know how many people have starred that repo, see what’s changed, open a bug or request features, manage projects, write wikis for those projects, and more. You can even (with respect to the repo’s license) branch off your own copy of the code to tinker with and use. I use GitHub and Git for Magrathea because they’re built to serve exactly this type of project and are great at it.

    And the cherry on top? **Open source projects on GitHub can accept [pull requests](https://help.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). This means that anybody who fixes a bug or adds a new feature can contribute those changes back to the original project, and will automatically and visibly be given credit for their contribution.** This can be a great way to help community resources continue to grow and improve. It can also be a great way to learn!

Does this all mean you’re opposed to paid commissions?
:   Not at all! We're well aware of the amount of time, thought, energy, and heart that goes into writing code for others and we absolutely believe that folks should be compensated for their work. We are fortunate enough to be in a position where we are able to provide resources for free, and we believe doing so actually benefits those who offer paid commissions. We believe the transparency into the process that we can offer here can help non-code savvy folks see just how much work all of this actually is, as well as recognize well-written code when they see it and better appreciate the value of it.

Would you consider taking payment instead to keep a commission closed source? Or only making part of it open source?
:   No, sorry. Magrathea is meant to benefit our community as much as possible, and doing either of those things limits the potential benefits that could be provided. There are lots of coders out there that will take on commissions under those kind of terms though!
