        <p>So what does Magrathea offer? Broadly speaking, free, high quality, open source code. But that’s an extremely brief way to say a whole lot, so let’s break it down.</p>

                <p>The resources provided through Magrathea don't cost you any money. There are some terms you'll need to follow, but Magrathea’s publicly available projects exclusively fall under open source licenses<sup><a id="footnote-1-reference" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>, whose terms are meant to be straightforward and to benefit creators and communities. In fact, <strong>the terms of most Magrathea projects are as simple as providing credit</strong>. You can get full details for any specific Magrathea project from its associated license file.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>"High quality code" here means code that tries its darnedest to be both approachable and accessible.</p>

                <h4 id="heading-what-is-approachable-code">What is Approachable Code?</h4>
                
                <p>Approachable code is code that is:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Organized</strong> in a considered and consistent way that includes clear names and structure
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Easily maintained</strong>. Someone trying to fix a bug or make an update in the code should be able to understand the ripple effects of doing so
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code">Self-documenting</a></strong>, and includes well-structured supplemental documentation as needed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Built on modern standards</strong>, and so is free of outdated, deprecated, or obsolete ways of doing things
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Something others can learn from</strong> or make use of in ways that jumpstart or simplify their own efforts
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h4 id="heading-what-is-accessible-code">What is Accessible Code?</h4>
                
                <p>Anybody who wants to write should be able to participate in our community regardless of the ways they need or want to approach our sites. From a coding standpoint, that kind of inclusivity doesn’t just magically happen, it’s something we need to actively think about and support. That, for a few non-exhaustive examples, means coding for people who:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Rely on screen readers
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the keyboard to navigate a site
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use touchscreen devices
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Are negatively affected by excess motion
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Modify their browser’s default font settings such as increasing font size or swapping in a more legible font face
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Struggle with insufficient text contrast
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Find it difficult to interact with small clickable areas
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Can’t differentiate between things based on color alone
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have slower or lower bandwidth internet connections
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            View the site from screens with different sizes or resolutions
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>This doesn’t mean the codes provided through Magrathea will be perfectly accessible always, but it is a commitment to doing the best we can and learning from our shortcomings (so please do reach out if you see something that could be better!).</p>
                    
                <hr>
                
                <p>Writing code that’s approachable and accessible isn’t always easy, but if we keep it in mind upfront and throughout the process, we can hopefully remove a lot of friction for a lot of folks on a lot of fronts.</p>
