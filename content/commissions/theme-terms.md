# How Do Custom Theme Commissions Work?

Long story short, Magrathea commissions work a bit differently than your typical commission. You pay no money, you're asked to provide the graphics, and the whole thing comes with a community-contributing twist: **We donate the full theme (minus the graphics) to the community when you’re not using it anymore for the site it was made for**.

And as for the long story...

## You Get

- {{< bold >}}You get{{< /bold >}} a complete, custom theme[^1] for your site (which can be on any forum host[^2]) and it's coded in an [approachable]({{< ref "/#what-is-approachable-code" >}}) and [accessible]({{< ref "/#what-is-accessible-code" >}}) way.
    - Includes all member templates (e.g. posting, communications, development, requests, etc.)
    - Includes all admin templates (e.g. announcements, claims, member directory, etc.)
    - Includes application and shipper templates
    - Includes the guidebook (e.g. rules, setting, member groups, etc.)
    - Includes elements that change based on member group
    - Includes whatever else you might need coded. Let us know what you’re looking for!
- {{< bold >}}You get{{< /bold >}} installation and configuration of the code
- {{< bold >}}You get{{< /bold >}} ongoing support, in case, for example, you ever run across a bug that needs fixing or a need a new template

[^1]: If you come from the Jcink subset of the community, you’re probably more familiar with the term "skin." We use "theme" here instead because it’s the more broadly used term, but they mean the same thing.

[^2]:While we do accept commissions for any forum host, please know that we only have experience with Jcink. We’re fully capable of and happy to learn how to build themes for others hosts, but that extra bit of learning will make the commission take more time. Thanks for your patience!

## You Have the Option

- {{< bold >}}You have the option{{< /bold >}} to access the code at all times (via GitHub), even while it’s under development
- {{< bold >}}You have the option{{< /bold >}} to provide feedback whenever. We’d love to hear what you think early and often!
- {{< bold >}}You have the option{{< /bold >}} to choose which areas of code get worked on next

## You Provide

- {{< bold >}}You provide{{< /bold >}} your thoughts, wishes, and feedback! This theme will be made to your specs, with input from us on keeping it accessible
- **{{< bold >}}You provide{{< /bold >}} the graphics and images. This includes things like backgrounds and staff avatars**

## We Can Discuss Who Provides

- {{< bold >}}We can discuss who provides{{< /bold >}} fonts
- {{< bold >}}We can discuss who provides{{< /bold >}} icons
- {{< bold >}}We can discuss who provides{{< /bold >}} the color palette. We’ll work with you here, too, to make any necessary tweaks for better accessibility

## We Agree

- **{{< bold >}}We agree{{< /bold >}} that when the site closes, dies, or moves on to a different theme, Magrathea crew will make the complete theme (minus any graphics, fonts, or icons you provided) freely available under an open source license to anybody who wants to use it, learn from it, modify it, whatever.**

  **This means the theme is exclusive to your site while your site’s around and then afterward becomes a donation that contributes to the wider community.**
                                    
  Examples of "closes or dies" include such situations as:
    - The site hasn’t opened yet, but development on it has stopped. We haven’t heard from you in over 30 days or you have explicitly said that the site won’t open or has in some way been shelved
    - The site was open, but there have been no in-character posts or plotting posts in over 30 days
    - The site was open, but you’ve since taken the board offline or announced that it will be closing

- {{< bold >}}We agree{{< /bold >}} to give each other and any supplemental resources we use due credit
- {{< bold >}}We agree{{< /bold >}} to respect the licenses of any supplemental resources we use. This can include anything from fonts to bits of functionality
- {{< bold >}}We agree{{< /bold >}} that either party can opt out of the project. We'll all let each other know what's going on and we'll all get to keep a copy of whatever code's already been completed to do with as we will

## You Can

- {{< bold >}}You can{{< /bold >}} make any edits you want to _your own copy_ of the code

  Please note, if you instead choose to add code changes to the project's Magrathea GitHub repository specifically, those changes will all be included in the open source version later on. You will, however, be given credit for your contribution

- {{< bold >}}You can{{< /bold >}} use the theme for any site you wish. The theme itself will still be created for one site in particular, and that one site is what counts for determining when to make the theme publicly available

## Magrathea Can

- {{< bold >}}Magrathea can{{< /bold >}} complete any unfinished theme to offer as an open source resource. This could happen if, for example, the site it was originally intended for dies in development
- {{< bold >}}Magrathea can{{< /bold >}} make a cancelled, unfinished theme publicly available as an open source resource as is, without finishing it. (Graphics, fonts, and icons you provided will still be removed before this happens)
