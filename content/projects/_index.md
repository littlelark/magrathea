# What Resources Are Currently Available?

All of the currently available Magrathea resources live as [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/)[^1] under the Magrathea organization. Only a few callouts will be featured here.

**As part of Magrathea, we also take on commissions to build out complete, custom themes/skins.** You can [find the commission terms here]({{< ref "/commissions/theme-terms" >}}).

[^1]: If you’re not familiar with GitHub, there are a lot of great learning resources out there, including GitHub’s own [documentation](https://docs.github.com/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github) and [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).
