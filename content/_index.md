**Written RPG communities are about writing.** And, tangentially, they’re about code. RPG sites can function just fine with the default code hosting sites provide, but we want these spaces to feel welcoming and homey, thematic and inspiring, we want them to be places we’re eager to cozy up in, sometimes as often as daily. But we’re writers, first and foremost, and these are writing spaces. How can we get what we seek out of code and also keep it out of the way as much as possible so we can focus on what we’re really here to do?

Magrathea is meant to be one possible answer to that question. It’s a collection of resources, and an offer of help. It’s an effort to make creating, maintaining, and participating in our hobby easier and more accessible. It’s a way to give back to our very unique and special community. And it won’t cost you any money.

## What Does Magrathea Offer?

So what does Magrathea offer? Broadly speaking, *high quality* code that is both *free and open source*. But that’s an extremely brief way to say a whole lot, so let’s break it down.

### Free And Open Source

The resources provided through Magrathea don't cost you any money. There are some terms you'll need to follow, but Magrathea’s publicly available projects exclusively fall under open source licenses[^1], whose terms are meant to be straightforward and to benefit creators and communities. In fact, **the terms of most Magrathea projects are as simple as providing credit**. You can get full details for any specific Magrathea project from its associated license file.

[^1]: If you've never heard of "open source" before, you can [find a great definition here](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#what-does-open-source-mean). You can also find a quick [summary of some of the most popular open source licenses here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/).

### High Quality Code

"High quality code" here means code that tries its darnedest to be both *approachable* and *accessible*.

#### What is Approachable Code?
            
Approachable code is code that is:

- **Organized** in a considered and consistent way that includes clear names and structure
- **Easily maintained**. Someone trying to fix a bug or make an update in the code should be able to understand the ripple effects of doing so
- **[Self-documenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code)**, and includes well-structured supplemental documentation as needed
- **Built on modern standards**, and so is free of outdated, deprecated, or obsolete ways of doing things
- **Something others can learn from** or make use of in ways that jumpstart or simplify their own efforts
            
#### What is Accessible Code?
            
Anybody who wants to write should be able to participate in our community regardless of the ways they need or want to approach our sites. From a coding standpoint, that kind of inclusivity doesn’t just magically happen, it’s something we need to actively think about and support. That, for a few non-exhaustive examples, means coding for people who:

- Rely on screen readers
- Use the keyboard to navigate a site
- Use touchscreen devices
- Are negatively affected by excess motion
- Modify their browser’s default font settings such as increasing font size or swapping in a more legible font face
- Struggle with insufficient text contrast
- Find it difficult to interact with small clickable areas
- Can’t differentiate between things based on color alone
- Have slower or lower bandwidth internet connections
- View the site from screens with different sizes or resolutions
            
This doesn’t mean the codes provided through Magrathea will be perfectly accessible always, but it is a commitment to doing the best we can and learning from our shortcomings (so please do reach out if you see something that could be better!).

Writing code that’s approachable and accessible isn’t always easy, but if we keep it in mind upfront and throughout the process, we can hopefully remove a lot of friction for a lot of folks on a lot of fronts.
