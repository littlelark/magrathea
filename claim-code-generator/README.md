# Claim Code Generator

## What is it?

I wrote the original version of this tool for [The Breach](https://breached.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=7&view=findpost&p=30). The version provided here has been generalized and more thoroughly documented for easier use on other sites.

A [demo version of the generator](https://littlelark.github.io/magrathea/claim-code-generator/claim-code-generator.html) is available via this repo.

## What's included?

- `claim-code-generator.html` (required) is the form members will interact with
- `claim-code-generator.js` (required) constructs the claim HTML when members submit the form
- `claim-code-generator.css` (optional) provides bare bones styling for the demo version (and can be built upon for actual use)
