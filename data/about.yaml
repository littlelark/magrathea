tagline: Free and open source resources for forum-based RPG sites
pitch:
    - <b>Forum RP sites are about writing.</b> And, tangentially, they’re about code. RP sites can function just fine with the default code hosts provide, but we want these spaces to feel welcoming and homey, thematic and inspiring, we want them to be places we’re eager to cozy up in, sometimes as often as daily. But we’re writers, first and foremost, and these are writing spaces. How can we get what we seek out of code and also keep it out of the way as much as possible so we can focus on what we’re really here to do?
    - Magrathea is meant to be one possible answer to that question. It’s a collection of resources, and an offer of help. It’s an effort to make creating, maintaining, and participating in RP sites easier and more accessible. It’s a way to give back to our very unique and special community. And it won’t cost you any money."
