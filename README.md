# Magrathea
A collection of tools, resources, and notes for forum-based roleplaying sites, primarily focused on Jcink-hosted sites.

This particular repo serves as a hub for the collection. The tools and resources themselves can be found in their own repos (to make them easier to fork) all under the [rp-magrathea org](https://github.com/rp-magrathea).

## Available Tools
 - [**Vogsphere**](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/vogsphere): Automatically generates claim codes for forum RP site members based on filling out a form, rather than having members directly edit code.
 - [**YAGPDB Discord Bot Custom Command Sets**](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/yagpdb-cc)
   - *Question and Answer*: Creates a queue of unanswered member questions and tracks progress on these. Can automatically send questions to the queue or answers to a designated FAQ channel using staff-limited reactions to messages.
   - *Utilities*: Supporting custom commands
