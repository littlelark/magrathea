# Magrathea
A collection of tools, resources, and notes for rp sites, primarily focused on Jcink-hosted sites.

This particular repo serves as a hub for the collection. The tools and resources themselves can be found in their own repos (to make them easier to fork) all under the [rp-magrathea org](https://github.com/rp-magrathea).
