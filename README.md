# Magrathea
A collection of tools, resources, and notes for forum-based roleplaying sites, primarily focused on Jcink-hosted sites.

This particular repo serves as a hub for the collection. The tools and resources themselves can be found in their own repos (to make them easier to fork) all under the [rp-magrathea org](https://github.com/rp-magrathea).

## The License

As you'll see from [the included license](LICENSE), everything in this repository is free to use however you wish without any restrictions or stipulations. You donâ€™t even have to give credit (though credit is both always appreciated and a way to help others find these resources too!).

All of the tools and resources included in this project will also be provided under this same license.

## Available Tools
 - [**Vogsphere**](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/vogsphere): Automatically generates claim codes for forum RP site members based on filling out a form, rather than having members directly edit code.
 - [**YAGPDB Discord Bot Custom Command Sets**](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/yagpdb-cc)
   - *Question and Answer*: Creates a queue of unanswered member questions and tracks progress on these. Can automatically send questions to the queue or answers to a designated FAQ channel using staff-limited reactions to messages.
   - *Utilities*: Supporting custom commands
